    * D82 images of 8250 drives
    * D64 images of 4040/2031/1540/1541/1551/1570 drives
    * D71 images of 1571 drives
    * D40 images of early 2040 drives with Firmware V1

* 3,5":
    * D81 images of 1581 drives
    * D1M, D2M and D4M images of CMD FD2000 and CMD FD4000 drives

* Hard disks:
    * DHD support for CMD HDD images
    * D60 support for 9060 images
    * D90 support for 9090 images
    * D16 support for [Ruud Baltissen's special format](http://www.baltissen.org/newhtm/diskimag.htm)
